# Storify<br>

### Problem Statement: <br>
There are multiple stores in a company that sells groceries including fruits and vegetables. Every day, the stores publish the fresh produce received in each store to that particular WhatsApp group. However, by the time some customers arrive at the store to purchase those items, some of the items are already sold out. This is making the customers unhappy. The company needs a way to provide real-time inventory to customers so that they know exactly what will be availabe when they arrive at a store.
